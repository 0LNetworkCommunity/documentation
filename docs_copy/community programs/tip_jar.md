# TIP JAR
Source: https://github.com/infinite-game-llc/tip-jar/blob/main/README.md

Core engineering on 0L has been an unfunded volunteer effort. For example, since about June 2019 the lead 0L developer -- github user `0o-de-lally` -- has contributed an estimated 5,060 man-hours exclusively to core protocol (last updated Sept 24th 2021). This effort was not compensated in any form.

Please consider donating to Tip Jar at the 0L address: `2B0E8325DEA5BE93D856CFDE2D0CBA12`. When you donate by depositing to this address you will be effectively sharing your miner or validator with the program and as such with core contributors.

This address is marked as a “CommunityWallet” on chain. As such funds from Tip Jar can only be transferred to an 0L "Slow Wallet" which releases funds over time. It implements the DonorVoice module so that donors to this wallet can veto transactions and ultimately freeze the account. The address is managed by Infinite Game LLC, a US validator company wholly owned by `0o-de-lally`.

# April 2023 Update
