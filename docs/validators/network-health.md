# Network Health
Seeds node and RPC endpoint lists for the network are maintained in [this repository](https://github.com/0LNetworkCommunity/seed-peers).

CI jobs in the seed-peers repository check that the nodes specified in the lists therein are up and responding:

 - [Seed Peers Checks](https://github.com/0LNetworkCommunity/seed-peers/actions/workflows/check-seed-peers.yaml)
 - [RPC Service Checks](https://github.com/0LNetworkCommunity/seed-peers/actions/workflows/check-fullnode-playlist.yaml)
