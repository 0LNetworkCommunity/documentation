# Documentation tutorial

- 0L Network Documentation repo is based on [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) tool.

- You can **play around with Docusaurus online** at **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

## Run this repo locally

- As a requirement to run Docusaurus locally, you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above installed on your machine.
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.
- Fork the current repository and clone it.
- Create a new branch with `git branch new_branch_name`

```bash
# Go to the repository directory in your local machine
cd documentation
# Run the Docusaurus locally
npm run start
```

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.
