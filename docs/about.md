1. Yes, We Took It
------------------------------------

We hard-forked Facebook¹ out of Libra.

2. To Fulfill the Promise of Good Capital
------------------------------------

Crypto promised us spiritually elevated capital which could make the future
arrive faster.
Said capital now belongs to banks, ETFs, and hedge funds.
And tech of blockchains will soon be in the rear-view mirror.

3. By Producing the Best Open Asset
------------------------------------

Singularly focused on an accessible, perpetual, and meaningful digital property.
Prosperity comes from people saving and planning for interventions in society.
Without financial nihilism, pyramid schemes, obfuscation and confusion.
100% of LIBRA has already been produced, 95% of which has been saved, pledged, or donated to the future.

4. Which is Fiercely Independent,
------------------------------------

We make the right choices because we don't owe anything to anyone.
- Government proof: every coin was mined and no money ever raised.
- No Labs or Foundation: yes to moral authority and meritocracy.
- So long, Crypto industry: let's play games the world wants to play.
- No thanks, VCs: we have no rush, and infinite possibilities.

5. Uses Modern Tools,
------------------------------------

Having our own Layer-1 blockchain keeps us free.
We've been running experimental Diem and Move networks since 2019.
Focused on LIBRA, not Blockchain
We intend for the chain to have all the Smart Contracts you need to use, save,
plan with LIBRA, but none of the garbage to distract us.

6. Has Plans Measured in Centuries,
------------------------------------

We play a long game that few have patience for.
We don't need all the answers now.
We hold the space for future generations to discover the key which unlocks the asset.


7. To Become a Perpetual Social Force
------------------------------------
