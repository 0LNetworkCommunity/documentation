# The iqlusion Engineering Program
Iqlusion intends to supervise the evolution and extension of 0L blockchain from itâ€™s current nascent form into a full feature base layer in the multichain world. We intend to establish a mature engineering program around 0L with design documents, ADR, pull requests and code review to ensure a stable and robust blockchain platform. Of particular interest to us is developing an engineering program to connect 0L to the Internet of Blockchains via support for Ethereum and IBC interoperability.

Funds donated to the iqlusion Engineering program will be used to establish and compensate community members engaged in engineering work both original work, maintenance and review of the code.
