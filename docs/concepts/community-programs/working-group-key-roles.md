# Working Group Key Roles Program

This program is intended to sponsor leaders (Key Roles) of the informal Working Groups for Open Libra (0L network) contributors.

## Working Group Volunteers

In January of 2022, the community adopted a proposal to implement an experimental informal community governance process called "Working Groups". Working groups are self-assembled, optional, and done on a volunteer basis.

However, this experiment at times may need to use LIBRA for different purposes, including sponsoring some experts and leaders. This program exists to facilitate those cases.
