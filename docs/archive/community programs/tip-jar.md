Core engineering on 0L has been an unfunded volunteer effort. In the past two and half years the lead 0L developer, github user 0o\-de\-lally, has contributed an estimated 5,060 man\-hours exclusively to core protocol (Sept 24th 2021\). This effort was not compensated in any form.




Please consider donating to that developer’s tip jar at address: **2B0E8325DEA5BE93D856CFDE2D0CBA12**  
This address is marked as a “CommunityWallet” on chain. Funds will only be transferred to an 0L SlowWallet, which releases funds over time. Two\-thirds of validators (by voting power) can vote to reject the outbound transactions.
