We've released, today, a new version of the 0L Network's Carpe Wallet \& Desktop Miner. This release (v.0\.3\.0\) is our latest release in the Carpe Beta series and includes significant new functionality, including multilingual support and a new tab "Events", which displays a list of events associated with your account (i.e., when coins move in and out of the wallet). This latest version ships with Chinese, Portuguese, and French language support. It is our plan to add additional languages in the near future. 




To upgrade to the latest version, simply shut down and then restart your Carpe instance. You should be prompted to install the new version. Thanks to all on the Dev Team for making this happen! For those of you who are new to Carpe, [follow this link to grab the installer](https://github.com/0LNetworkCommunity/carpe) for Mac or WIN
