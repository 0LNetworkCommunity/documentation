Community wallets are an emergent property of the network. The wallets have typically\xa0 been created to fund programs for the benefit of the community. Part of their role is to safeguard capital for future uses. The vast majority of them have some language related to: a) safeguarding capital for future use in the network, b) deploying that capital. According to the disclosures of these accounts the capital is not used for personal or company enrichment.\nGiven their stated role, taxing the community wallets is taxing our growth capital. If you reduce the size of community wallets in favor of infrastructure escrow (IEF), you are reducing the amount of discretionary investment capital.\xa0\nIn the extreme case: If you tax community wallets 100% into the IEF, while we will solve problem one (security capital), we would fail on the second problem (there will be no funds to credibly attract future talent and entrepreneurship).1\nWe are left with charging the Validators."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"how-much-do-we-ask-validators-to-contribute",children:"How much do we ask validators to contribute?"}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"If we keep with the numbers above, Validators should contribute 80% of past rewards towards the future IEF.

We conducted a survey to find out how much volunteers have contributed over time, and what is the approximate value of that work. We asked the same of validators, as well as engineers.\nThe results of our (limited3) research showed that, at the extremes, workers had a cost per coin that was up to 45X higher\xa0 than the costs incurred by the Validators. Another way to look at it, the cost per coin (from lost wages and infrastructure payments) that pure Validators paid was 1/45 that of the top contributors (all rewards considered). That\'s about a 98% discount4, according to our research numbers. Paying more did not confer the workers any advantage in volume (they were not able to accumulate more share of the network).\nAfter the dilution, Validators are still getting an extremely attractive proposition. Excluding outliers (0D for example) the typical validator accounts still have paid 87% less than the top 10 worker accounts.5 It would be inappropriate, however, to conclude that the workers have been given a superior deal. The vast majority of workers have the majority of their coins from validator work. And those accounts will also be contributing 80%. This can only be corrected by using the community wallets judiciously.\nDespite the workers not being explicitly and mechanically taxed, they have already been (e.g., inflation). Even after this intervention, and considering possible uses of community wallets to "make-whole" these workers, in the best case the largest passive validators will have a 76% discount on cost per coin versus the lead engineers. While we can make it better, we can\u2019t fix everything.\nLastly, the most committed Validators will partially reclaim their contributions to IEF if they commit to validating over the long term.
