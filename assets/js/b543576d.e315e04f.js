Leslie Lamport published the Byzantine Generals Problem in 1982, laying the foundation for multiple breakthroughs in distributed computing over the past four decades. The goal of BFT protocols is to solve the Byzantine Generals problem, i.e., reach consensus among a set of nodes where some of the nodes might be dishonest. The Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant (PBFT) protocol established a standard for BFT protocols running in production. We've seen multiple variants of PBFT developed by optimizing parameters, such as rounds, to reach finality and messages broadcast. For instance, the improvements on the aggregation of signatures with the BLS scheme allowed us to reduce the number of broadcasted messages. Protocols such as HotStuff progressed BFT to consensus linearity wherein an agreement on a message is reached in a single round. Pipelining of blocks in HotStuff guarantees the finality of the proposed block by the third block following the proposed block. These advances in consensus are highly desirable and future blockchains will likely continue to use variations on these protocols."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"blockchains-and-bft",children:"Blockchains and BFT"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Any blockchain open to the world essentially has to solve the Byzantine Generals problem of reaching consensus among (un)trusted parties. The earliest blockchains addressed BFT by stating that higher computational power will increase the probability of proposing the next block (Proof of Work), i.e., using computational power as a substitute for identity. Over time, this led to an arms race of investing in computational resources, i.e., making higher capital investments to increase the likelihood of proposing a new block and thereby earning the associated rewards. Furthermore, this introduced the game-theoretic assumption that one would not harm the system they are highly invested in. Though this addresses Byzantine Generals' problem in a trustless setting, experience has shown that out-of-band coordination can lead to centralization (e.g. with the emergence of mining pools). Furthermore, PoW struggles to scale to the transactional demands of contemporary use-cases, creating along the way increased waste and exacerbating concerns about energy usage."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"By decoupling the establishment of identity and reaching consensus, we could better solve the problems inherent in current approaches.
