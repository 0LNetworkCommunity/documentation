This is functionally equivalent to the reverse auction where the validator would bid 4 coins. The difference is that the node is bonded within the epoch. The payment to get a validator seat is final.

Now validators will bid up to 1 for the right to earn 5 but this means that a validator that fails to validate loses only 1. Worse yet if the baseline reward falls to less than 4 then eventually no validators show up. To solve for this, a \u201cthermostatic\u201d solution could be applied: as in home heating devices, the heat increases or decreases by a certain amount to target a given temperature.\xa0"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Let\u2019s look at an example. Let the baseline reward be BR and the cost of validation C then validators will bid up to BR-C to enter the validation set. To simplify notation we can assume that C contains an opportunity cost of capital so that if bidders are paid C they are earning a normal profit. In this case, in a competitive market, bids will rise until Bid=BR-C. (Recall from the previous example that BR was 10, C was 4 and bids rose to 6). The bid is also the equivalent bond since it is the bid which may be lost by failing to validate. Now from this perspective, there is an easy solution to setting the baseline reward: Set it absurdly high, say 1000. In this case bids will rise to 996 and validators will be extremely careful never to fail to validate since the bond is 996. The problem with this simple solution is that the higher the bond the greater the rewards to collusion and the more risk is imposed on validators. The competitive price in this scenario is 996 but even minimal collusion that brought the price down to say 900 would create very large profits and thus this model is asking for collusion. Even without collusion there may arise a situation where, for accidental or unusual reasons, there are only a handful of bidders who bid say 900 or less and thus they win the rights to earn 1000 for a pittance. In addition, a very high bid/bond means that an error on the part of the validators (\u201ctrembling hands\u201d) subjects them to large losses. Risk aversion may then dissuade bidders from bidding which in turn could make collusion easier. High fees could thus potentially put the network at risk. Low fees, however, result in too few bidders as we noted above."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Thus, the protocol must target a bid (BR-C) which is large enough to promote good and careful behavior on the part of the validators but also small enough to not induce collusion and to withstand \u201ctrembling hands,\u201d i.e. small errors in competitive behavior or execution.
