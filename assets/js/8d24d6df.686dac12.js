Every epoch, you can only join the validator set if you have at least 4 peers known to be good actors vouching for you.

We\u2019re increasing the burn from 1 coin to 50% of validator rewards. Those funds will be distributed each epoch among the community wallets based on donations to those wallets. Validators also have the option to give more than 50% if they wish, and if they do not want to divert the funds to the community wallets, they can elect to have the coins burned.

This approach not only helps provide critical network funding, it also incentivizes validators to participate in consensus in order to earn rewards and avoid the clawback of their previously earned coins. We expect this change to be controversial with some people and we have suspended the implementation of the Proof of Burn on inactive validators for 10 epochs. During that time, people can learn more about it and discuss. If there are substantial objections, the issue will be debated and revisited.\xa0"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The changes to the validator onboarding and economics may not be guaranteed to reach the desired state, but directionally, they move us closer to the goal: Engaged validators who are stewards of the chain.
