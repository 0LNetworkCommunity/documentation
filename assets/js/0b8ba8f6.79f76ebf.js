So compared to Ethereum, much of what happens in a smart contract, can actually be split into long lived code in a module, and transaction-scripts which can import from the module (and other modules).

In our genesis, all candidates had to submit a Delay Tower "proof zero", an initial proof of work. All registrants are expected to provide their own layout file.
